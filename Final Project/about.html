    <h3><span style="color:#2e80b0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Glad to have you here! A little about me...</span> I was born and raised in the beautiful city of Toronto, Canada. Growing up I have always been drawn to science fiction. Reading it, watching it, anything related to science fiction had me hooked.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I grew older I became more and more obssessed with technology. Which is what ultimately led to me wanting to work with computers in some capacity.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, I am a second year student at the Community College of Baltimore County studying Information Technology. My goal in the future is to complete my degree, also obtain my bachelors degree, and work at a company that is suitable for me.</h3>
