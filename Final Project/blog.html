      <p>Welcome to my blog! My first post will just be me discussing some of my interests.</p>
      <p>My favorite pasttimes include working out, learning languages, cooking, and learning geography!</p>
      <p>Now, as a young adult, I have developed a more refined and minimalist style. I focus on quality over quantity, investing in timeless pieces that can be mixed and matched for various occasions.</p>
      <p>Throughout my life I have come to love many different areas of life. I will continue to share my inspirations in this blog! Thank you for reading :D</p>
