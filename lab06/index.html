      <div id="list">
        <ol>
          <li>  We first begin by preparing the meatballs. Empty your ground beef and Italian sausage into a mixing bowl. <i> Be sure to take the casing off the sausages. </i> Crack in the egg. Put in a handful of breadcrumbs. Toss in about a tablespoon of pepper, salt, your Italian seasoning, and a dash of cayenne pepper for some extra flavor. </li>
          <li> Mix using your hands and combine all the ingredients together. Once complete, roll the meatballs into a ball and then coat all the meatballs in a thin and even layer of flour. </li>
          <li> Pour a tablespoon of high quality olive oil into a cast-iron skillet and heat over medium-high heat. </li>
          <li> Begin placing the meatballs into the pot and frying on each side for about 3-5 minutes. Once a brown crust begins to form on one side, flip all the meatballs and continue frying until all complete. </li>
          <li> Set aside the meatballs. Follow the instructions on the spaghetti package for boiling the spaghetti in a deep pot.</li>
          <li> Cook the spaghetti until al dente and then drain. Set aside to toss in the sauce later. </li>
          <li> In the same pot you fried the meatballs, put in the 1/2 diced onion and chopped garlic. Saute until aromatic. Then pour in your 28oz can of crushed tomatoes. Pour in your marinara sauce. Put in your Italian seasoning and grated cheese. Then mix together and stir. </li>
          <li> Allow it to come to a boil. Add your meatballs to the sauce mixture and stir thoroughly. After a few minutes, allow it to simmer on low, covered, for about 10 minutes. </li>
          <li> Finally add your spaghetti to the mixture and stir thoroughly. <i> You can keep your meatballs and spaghetti separate if you like! </i> Top your masterpiece off with some chopped parsely.</li>
          <li> Plate, and enjoy! </li>
