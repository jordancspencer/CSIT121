		<p> <span class="Name"> Chess </span> is an incredible strategic game that pits two minds against one another on a 64 square board. <br> I taught myself how to play at the age of 8 and continued studying and playing the game ever since. <br> I think it's a beautiful game which can both be good for developing the mind and teaching life lessons. <br> Pictured above is my favorite player, the reigning world champion - Magnus Carlsen.</p>
