		<p> <span class="Name"> Finance </span> and investing is an area that has long interested since I was a teenager. <br> Learning how to manage my own money was something that was astutely taught to me <br> by my parents. I grew up appreciating the value of money and learning how to invest. <br> As I grew older, I grew particularly fond of value investing and read books from investors <br> like Paul Graham and Ray Dalio. Pictured above is the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
