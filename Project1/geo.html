		<p> <span class="Name"> Earth </span> is our home. An extensively beautiful one at that. I love learning about all the <br> different regions of the world and how they came to be. I grew up having many maps <br> and globes in my room and always had a deep love for the world and travelling. <br> I have been to 13 countries and can name all of the flags and capitals of the world!</p>
